                        <p><B>1. Keep It Relevant</B><br>
                        Focus your introduction on details the interviewers would <br>
                        find most relevant. Tailor it based on the role and company.<br>
                        For example, for a teaching job highlight your education, experience<br>
                        with students and teaching skills. For a sales job, feature your <br>
                        sales achievements, customer service skills and product knowledge.<br><p>
                        <b>2. Structure Your Content</b><br>
                        Organize your content in a clear, logical structure:<br>
            
                        • Name and where from<br>
                        • Education/degree and school<br>
                        • Work experience and achievements<br>
                        • Skills and strength<br>
                        •Interest or hobby<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>3. Emphasize Skills</b><br>
                    Carefully choose which of your skills, strengths and <br>
                    achievements to highlight based on the target job.For <br>
                    example, creative skills for design roles, analytical<br>
                    abilities for accounting, collaboration for team-oriented<br>
                    jobs, and so on. Give specific examples of using those<br>
                    skills successfully.  <br>
                     <b>5. Keep Within 2 Minutes</b><br>
                    Interview introductions should be kept short - ideally<br>
                    Provide a concise overview of your most relevant<br>
                    credentials. Elaborating can come later during the<br>
                    actual interview <br>
            
                    <b>6. Practice Aloud</b><br>
                    Practice introducing yourself out loud several times before<br>
                    the interview. Get feedback frofriends.<br>
                    This boosts your delivery and reduces nervousness. Practice until<br>
                     the flow sounds natural<br>
                    </p>
    <p>
        <b>7. Show Enthusiasm</b><br>
        Sounding genuinely excited about the company and job opportunity<br>
         creates a very positive impression.<br>
        For example, "I'm truly excited about the chance to join ABC <br>
        Company's innovative marketing team."<br>
        <b>8. Listen to Cues</b><br>
        If the interviewers jump in with questions part way through your<br>
         introduction, take the cue to wrap up quickly. Don't keep talking <br>
        Aim to give concise responses from that point to best answer their<br>
         questions.<br>
        <b>9. Close on a Positive Note</b><br>
        End your introduction by expressing enthusiasm for the job interview<br>
         and your interest in the position.<br>
        For example, "I'm looking forward to discussing how I can contribute <br>
        to this role." This finish well.<br>
        Following these tips will make your self- introduction highly effective <br>
        and help get the interview off to a great start!<br>
